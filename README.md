## Hi, I'm Kike 😺👋
Hello! My name is Kike, pronounced as key-kEH (like the kEH sound in kettle). 



I'm a rising junior majoring in Computer Science + Design at the University of Illinois-Chicago. **Go Flames!** 🔥🐲 

At UIC I'm a member of UIC's Treble Choir, Gospel Choir at UIC, and Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS). I'll be graduating in May of 2027.

I haven't landed on a specfic career choice yet but at the moment but I'm leaning towards front-end development or something in cybersecurity. 🛡️

In my free time I love to read, watch anime, and photography. <ins>Some of my favorite animes include:</ins> The time I got reincarnated as a slime, Demon Slayer, and Dororo
